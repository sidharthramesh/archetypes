Examples of specific vaccinations and groupings of vaccinations effective against a specific infectious disease are Tetanus toxoid, and COVID-effective vaccinations, respectively.

Common use cases include, but are not limited to:
- Systematic questioning in any consultation related to patterns of vaccine administration, for example:
--- Do you ever been vaccinated for tetanus? Yes, No, Unknown.
--- Have you received a COVID booster in the past 6 months? Yes, No, Unknown.
-- How many COVID boosters have you received? When was the last one?

The semantics of this archetype are intentionally loose, and querying this archetype would normally only be useful or safe within the context of each specific template. In a template, each data element would usually be renamed to the specific question asked. Where value sets have been proposed for common use cases, these can be adapted for local use by using the DV_TEXT or the DV_BOOLEAN datatypes choice to match each specific use case.

The EVENT structure from the reference model can be used to specify whether the questions relate to point in time or over a period of time. Use a separate instance of this archetype to distinguish between a questionnaire recording information about a medication that has been used at any time in the past and information about a medication used within a specified time interval - for example the difference between \"Do you use paracetamol?\" compared to \"Have you been using any anticoagulants during the last four weeks?\".

The source of the information in a questionnaire response may vary in different contexts but can be specifically identified using the 'Information provider' element in the Reference Model.

This archetype has been designed to be used as a screening tool or to record simple questionnaire-format data for use in situations such as a disease registry. If the screening questionnaire identifies the administration of a vaccination it is recommended that the clinical system record and persist the specific details about the vaccination using a relevant archetype, for example the EVALUATION.immunisation_summary to record a detailed snapshot view about the immune status of an individual for a specific infectious disease or a relevant ACTION archetype to record details about a specific administration.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used for recording an order for a vaccine to be administered - use INSTRUCTION.medication_order for this purpose.

Not to be used for recording the administration, dispensing or consumption of a vaccine - use ACTION.vaccine for this purpose.

Not to be used for recording a summary of use of a vaccine over the lifetime of the individual - use EVALUATION.immunisation_summary for this purpose.

Not to be used to record details about the positive absence of a specific vaccine or grouping of vaccines, outside of a screening context. Use EVALUATION.exclusion_specific for this purpose.

Not to be used to create a framework for recording answers to pre-defined screening questions about adverse reactions, use an appropriate archetype for this purpose.">
